### **1. Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)**
This phase involves collecting information about the target passively or actively without engaging directly with the target’s system.

#### **Tools:**
- **Nmap**: Network discovery and scanning.
- **Netcat**: Networking utility for reading and writing data across networks.
- **theHarvester**: Gathers emails, subdomains, hosts, and open ports.
- **Maltego**: Open-source intelligence and forensics.
- **Recon-ng**: Web-based reconnaissance.
- **Shodan**: IoT and network search engine.
- **Dnsenum**: DNS enumeration.
- **FOCA**: Metadata extraction from documents.
- **Google Dorking**: Using Google search for hacking purposes.
- **OSRFramework**: Framework for open-source intelligence gathering.
- **SpiderFoot**: Automated reconnaissance.

### **2. Scanning and Enumeration**
After gathering basic information, scanning and enumeration help to map the target’s network, detect open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.

#### **Tools:**
- **Nmap**: Port scanning, service enumeration, and version detection.
- **Nessus**: Vulnerability scanner.
- **OpenVAS**: Open-source vulnerability scanner.
- **Nikto**: Web server scanner to find vulnerabilities.
- **Unicornscan**: Port scanning and service identification.
- **Hping3**: Packet crafting tool for network mapping.
- **Netcat**: Banner grabbing and port scanning.
- **Enum4Linux**: Enumeration of Windows machines via SMB.
- **SMBclient**: SMB protocol enumeration.
- **Snmpwalk**: Enumeration of SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) services.
- **Masscan**: Fast port scanner for large-scale scanning.
- **Metasploit Auxiliary Scanners**: To identify vulnerabilities in services.

### **3. Gaining Access (Exploitation)**
This phase is where vulnerabilities are exploited to gain access to the target system. It can involve password cracking, exploiting software vulnerabilities, or even using social engineering techniques.

#### **Tools:**
- **Metasploit Framework**: The most comprehensive exploitation framework.
- **Sqlmap**: Automated SQL injection tool.
- **Hydra**: Password brute-forcing.
- **John the Ripper**: Password cracking for hash types.
- **Medusa**: Brute-force login attack tool.
- **BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework)**: Focused on browser vulnerabilities.
- **Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)**: Social engineering attacks, including phishing.
- **Aircrack-ng**: Wi-Fi cracking and network security testing.
- **Mimikatz**: Extracts credentials from memory on Windows.
- **Exploit-db**: Database for publicly available exploits.
- **THC-Hydra**: Parallelized login cracker for various protocols.
- **Ettercap**: Man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Responder**: LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS poisoning tool.

### **4. Maintaining Access**
Once access is obtained, the goal is to maintain persistence within the system. This is achieved by installing backdoors or using other methods to ensure continued access.

#### **Tools:**
- **Metasploit Meterpreter**: Meterpreter is a payload for maintaining access and performing post-exploitation tasks.
- **Netcat**: Can be used as a backdoor for maintaining access.
- **Empire**: Post-exploitation agent for maintaining access.
- **Weevely**: Web shell tool for backdoor access.
- **Mimikatz**: For credential dumping and persistence.
- **Cobalt Strike**: Tool for adversary simulation and persistence.
- **SSH Tunnels**: For persistent access.
- **Nc Reverse Shells**: Reverse shells to maintain a connection to a victim’s system.
- **Crontab**: Schedule backdoors on Linux systems.
- **Task Scheduler (Windows)**: Schedules tasks for persistence on Windows systems.

### **5. Covering Tracks**
After the exploitation and maintaining access, ethical hackers must ensure they erase all footprints to avoid detection. This step ensures logs and tracks are cleaned up to leave no trace.

#### **Tools:**
- **Metasploit**: Contains tools to clean logs and clear command history.
- **Clear Logs in Linux (bash history, auth.log)**: Command to remove historical traces.
- **Shred**: Securely deletes files to prevent recovery in Linux.
- **Timestomp**: Part of Metasploit to change file timestamps.
- **Auditpol**: Tool to manage auditing policies on Windows.
- **Logclear (Meterpreter)**: Clears event logs via Metasploit.
- **History command**: Used to erase bash history in Linux.
- **Cloakify**: Encoding tool that allows data to blend into regular traffic to avoid detection.
- **Invoke-Obfuscation (PowerShell)**: Obfuscates PowerShell scripts to avoid detection.
- **Chainsaw**: A tool to detect and parse log manipulation.

### **Reporting**
While not officially part of the CEH phases, reporting is an important post-attack step where you document findings, vulnerabilities, and recommendations for mitigation.

#### **Tools:**
- **Dradis**: Information sharing platform for security assessments.
- **KeepNote**: Note-taking tool for pen testing documentation.
- **Faraday**: Collaborative penetration testing IDE.
- **MagicTree**: Tool to manage penetration testing data.
- **CherryTree**: Hierarchical note-taking application for organizing findings.
  
By mastering these tools and how they fit within each of the five phases of hacking, you'll be well-prepared for the CEH certification and practical penetration testing.
